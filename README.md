## Acknowledgment

This app is designed to mimic the existing website [models.com](https://models.com) through a reverse engineering study of the original site. It simplifies the key features of [models.com](https://models.com) and utilizes a limited-size seed database that was generated by collecting data from the website. It's important to note that this database may not accurately reflect the credits for actual work. This project is intended solely for educational purposes. For more comprehensive information about a work or individual, please visit [models.com](https://models.com) or the official websites of brands and entities.

- The navigation bar includes a website icon, a search box, and a drop-down menu for updates. When a user is logged in, it should display buttons for their profile, favorites, and logout. For users who are not logged in, it should show buttons for signing up and logging in. Clicking on the website icon will take you to the home page.

Clicking on the Signup button will take you to the signup page, while the Login button leads to the login page. Finally, clicking the Logout button will log out the current user and return them to the homepage.

- The homepage features two sets of card lists: one for "Models" and one for "Trending." Each list is accompanied by a "See All" link that will direct you to either the "All Works" page or the "All Models" page. 

- You can utilize the search box to access a page that displays all individuals with names similar to the search term or based on a specific role. Additionally, users have the option to search for works using the updates feature.

- The Favorites page displays a list of all the individuals that the user has added to their favorites list. Users can add a person to their favorites by visiting the person's detail page and clicking the "Add Favorites" button located below their profile image. Clicking this button once will add the person to the favorites list, and clicking it again will redirect the user to the Favorites page. In the Favorites page, users have the option to remove a person from their favorites list.

- Users can access a person's detail page by clicking on a person's card or by clicking on their name link throughout the website. On the person's detail page, you'll find information such as their biography, birthday, and nationality, if available. Additionally, the page will list the works in which this person has participated and a roster of related individuals with whom they have collaborated. The related people list is organized in descending order, based on the individuals with whom this person has worked the most.

- The Work Detail page provides essential information about a specific work. It includes details about the work itself and lists the crew members who contributed to its creation. Additionally, the page features a collection of images related to the work, with credits displayed below each image to acknowledge the contributors.

- The Signup, Login, and Profile pages serve specific functions within the system. The Signup page is used to create a user account, the Login page is used to authenticate users, and the Profile page allows users to update their profile information. 

- There are two types of users in the system: regular users and admin users. Regular users have access to all features except for the ability to upload work. Admin users have elevated privileges and can upload work. For those who wish to access admin functionalities, an existing admin user account is available with the username `testadmin` and the password `password`.
